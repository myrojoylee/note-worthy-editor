## Description:

A progressive web application (PWA) is a software application built on traditional web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) that is made to work on multiple platforms. In this work we completed code needed to create a manifest file and register a service worker in order to optimize offline access. Additionally, a feature of a PWA is its ability to be installed into the user's device. We will be able to see this functionality in a brief [demo](#usage) below.

## Installation:

- This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) application. This app should be able to run on v18+.

Please type the following in the terminal of your project's root directory to begin:

- `npm install` to install all needed dependencies

- `npm run start` to run the current build and start the server.

## Usage:

- Find the deployed application [here](https://note-worthy-editor-994ec6cf6337.herokuapp.com/).

The short demo below demonstrates the basic functionality of the JATE app.
